    "- **Neurons**: The basic units of the brain and nervous system. They receive input, process it, and send output to other neurons.\n",
    "- **Synapses**: Connections between neurons that allow them to communicate.\n",
    "*In the brain, learning happens by strengthening or weakening these connections based on experiences.*\n",
    "\n",
    "An Artificial Neural Network is a computational model that mimics the way biological neurons signal to one another.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To recognize patterns and relationships in data through a learning process.\n",
    "- **Functionality**: They can learn from data without being explicitly programmed with task-specific rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we get an inspiration from the brain, in reality all models do is use data to draw \"lines\".\n",
    "These \"lines\" group together areas, which allows for interpolation, categorizing new data.\n",

    "# Structure:\n",
    "- **Artificial Neurons**: Also called nodes; they receive input, process it, and produce output.\n",
    "- **Processing**: Each neuron sums its inputs and passes the result through an activation function.\n",
    "    - An activation function is used after every node does its magic so that it can fit to fancier data.\n",
    "- **Layers**\n",
    "    - **Input Layer**: Where the network receives input data.\n",
    "    - **Hidden Layers**: Layers between input and output layers where computations occur. This can be thought of as \"pattern recognition\".\n",
    "    - **Output Layer**: Where you take the output from the Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering a model that takes in \"images\" a.k.a. a vision model, you can think of each hidden layer as categorizing \"patterns\".\n",

    "Think of a neural network as a waterfall. The water (input data) flows from the top (input layer), cascades over rocks and obstacles (hidden layers and neurons), and eventually reaches the bottom (output layer). At each stage, the water is guided and redirected, similar to how data is transformed by weights and activation functions in each neuron.\n",

    "Imagine you're learning to play the piano by ear. You press a key hoping to play a specific note. If the sound isn't right, you listen to the difference between what you played and what you intended, then adjust your finger placement accordingly. \n",

    "Backpropagation involves the network adjusting its parameters based on the error of its output compared to the desired output.\n",

    "- **Calculate Error**: After forward propagation, determine the difference between the predicted output and the actual output using a loss function.\n",
    "- **Propagate Error Backwards**: Starting from the output layer, the error is sent back through the network.\n",
    "- **Adjust Weights and Biases**: The network updates its weights and biases to reduce the error for the next forward pass.\n",
